# 🛡️ My Python Cybersecurity Projects

This repository showcases my collection of **Python projects** focused on **cybersecurity, networking, and encryption**. Each project includes a brief description and a link to the repository.

| Project | Description | Link |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Simple-TCP-Server** | Lightweight TCP server for basic network communication and testing. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Simple-TCP-Server) |
| **Simple-UDP-Server** | Basic UDP server to receive and handle datagrams from clients. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Simple-UDP-Server) |
| **Multithreaded-Chat-Server** | TCP chat server supporting multiple clients simultaneously. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Multithreaded-Chat-Server) |
| **File-Transfer-Server** | Python server for transferring files securely over the network. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/File-Transfer-Server) |
| **CryptoCaesar** | Simple implementation of the Caesar cipher for encryption and decryption. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/CryptoCaesar) |
| **Caesar-Chat** | Chat application that uses the Caesar cipher to secure messages. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Caesar-Chat) |
| **ROT13** | Implementation of the ROT13 cipher for text encoding and decoding. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/ROT13) |
| **UDP-chat-server-ROT13** | UDP chat server that encrypts messages using ROT13 for simple message obfuscation. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/UDP-chat-server-ROT13) |
| **Remote-cmd-execution** | Python tool for executing commands remotely on target machines. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Remote-cmd-execution) |
| **Netcat_Replacement** | Custom Python implementation of Netcat, capable of establishing TCP connections and transferring data interactively. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Netcat_Replacement) |
| **Port_Scanner** | Fast TCP/UDP port scanner with optional service detection and banner grabbing. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Port_Scanner) |
| **Threaded-DirBrute** | Small multithreaded directory brute‑forcer that reads paths from a wordlist and checks URL+path concurrently for quick reconnaissance or lab testing. | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Threaded-DirBrute) |
| **Recursion-Tuned-DirBrute** | Multithreaded directory brute‑forcer with recursive scanning and jitter controls to avoid detection; optimized for speed and stability in lab/recon environments (educational use only). | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Recursion-Tuned-DirBrute) |
| **Web-Bruteforce** | Minimal Python HTTP Basic Auth brute-forcer, tries passwords from a wordlist (lab/authorized testing only). | [Repo](https://github.com/zared1/Web-Bruteforce) |
